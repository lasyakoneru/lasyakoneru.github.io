<h3>My Experiences</h3>
	<h4>Computer Science Commuter Bridge Program:</h4>
	<p>The Computer Science Commuter Bridge Program was a summer program I completed at Michigan State University before my freshman year had begun. In this program I learned the basics of coding in Python and used that to code a Microbit to display custom LED sequences. I also used TinkerCAD to build a 3-D design. I personally designed a silver heart shaped necklace that had my name on it. Lastly, I had built a Marble maze out of cardboard, paper, string, and paperclips that could functionally have a marble roll down without breaking. In this program I had learned how much one small bit of code could do and the importance of teamwork.</p>

	<h4>Kids Who Code:</h4>
	<p>I am the Vice President of the Kids Who Code club. In this club we travel to several elementary and middle schools to teach kids how to code. We use the basic online tool called SCRATCH. This tool allows kids to learn game development, animation, and interactive story creation. One of our main goals was to advocate and empower kids to think creatively, reason systematically and work collaboratively. This club was one of the major influences that pushed me to major in Computer Science. Kids Who Code has empowered me to want to help make a difference in the world with something like code.</p>
